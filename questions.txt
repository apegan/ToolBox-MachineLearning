Alisha Pegan's responses

1. What is the general trend in the curve?
    The trend is that the accuracy increases when more data is used for training.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?
    The curve is noisier when approx. 30%-40% of the data is used for training.
    It appears that when 30% of the data is used for training, the algorithm can
    reach 50% accuracy. Additional data for training changes or reduces that accuracy,
    and then learning needs to recalculate to become more accurate.

3. How many trails do you need to go get a smooth curve?
    Around 70-100 trails is needed for a smooth curve.

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)). What
  happens?
    The curve changes significantly. I changed the the regression to be
     LogisticRegression(C=10**-1), and the curve looks like a corner curve.
